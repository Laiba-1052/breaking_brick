# Brick Breaking Game


A Brick Breaker Game built in Java using Swing for GUI and JDBC for user authentication. Brick Breaker is a classic arcade game where a ball is bounced using a paddle to break bricks. The game features:
Graphical UI with Java Swing
Sign In and Sign Up functionality (connected to MS Access database)
Increasing levels of difficulty
Score and life tracking

## Features

Login & Signup system using JDBC and MS Access

Interactive gameplay with keyboard controls

Dynamic brick layout with varying durability

Object-Oriented design with separate classes for game logic and UI



## Tools used

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

NetBeans Java IDE

MS Access

UCanAccess JDBC Driver

## How it works

Launch Screen: The game starts with a splash screen titled "BREAKING BRICK".

Authentication: Players must either sign in or sign up using the forms built with Java Swing. Credentials are verified using a local MS Access database via JDBC.

Game Start: Once authenticated, the GamePlay panel opens, where:
A paddle is controlled using left/right arrow keys.
A ball bounces and breaks the bricks generated by MapGenerator.java.

Game Logic:
Players score points by breaking bricks.
Lives are reduced if the ball hits the bottom.
If all bricks are broken, the player wins.
Players can restart with ENTER or increase difficulty with D.

Levels & Scoring: Higher levels increase brick count and game difficulty.
